      "jr": "The big one that started it all.\nThis board maps out the sprawling JR lines across Tokyo and its neighbouring prefectures - it was actually part of the original MetroM Kickstarter that kicked this whole thing off.",
      "metro": "A more focused take on Tokyo's rail system.\nI concentrated on the Tokyo Metro lines (plus the essential JR Yamanote and Chuo-Sobu), which let me really dig into all those fascinating connections in the city centre.",
      "sg2030": "The future of Singapore's MRT, all mapped out.\nWhen LTA dropped their 2030 plan with the Cross Island and Jurong Region Lines, I knew I had to make a board showing the whole ambitious network.",
      "sg2027": "Singapore MRT's compact cousin.\nA smaller, cosier version that includes all the confirmed lines up to 2027. Perfect when you want something more space-friendly.",
      "sf": "Three networks, one beautiful mess.\nThe Bay Area's transit is wonderfully chaotic, with BART, VTA, and Caltrain all doing their own thing. This design brings them all together in one cohesive map."
