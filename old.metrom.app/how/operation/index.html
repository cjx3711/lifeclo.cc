                <p>
                  This might sound stupid, but there was originally had no way to turn off the board except unplugging it. So I'm including this as a feature.

                <p>
                  Each train line can be turned on or off. The lines are controlled by shift registers which simply store a 1 or 0 for each line.

              <h2 class="section-title">Powering the Board</h2>
              <p>The board can be powered in 3 ways</p>
              <div class="section-block">
                <h3 id="pwr-usb" class="block-title">USB Cable (recommended)</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the recommended way to power the board. You will need a micro USB cable and any USB power source. This source can be a power bank so you can bring the board around and show people if you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To turn it on with the cable plugged in, set the switch to the <code>USB</code> position.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="section-block">
                <h3 id="pwr-aaa" class="block-title">4 &times; AAA Batteries</h3>
                <p>
                  You can choose to power the board with 4x AAA batteries if you have the battery holder installed. It is not really meant to be powered with batteries and it will only last about a day or two on battery power. This will be useful if you want to bring it around and you don't want to have a power bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To turn it on with the batteries in, set the switch to the <code>BATTERY</code> position.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="section-block">
                <h3 id="pwr-dc" class="block-title">Direct 5V DC power</h3>
                <p>
                  There are some 5V and GND pinouts on the board itself. If you feel like installing your own power source, you can solder wires directly to these pinouts and power the board directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that this will bypass the switch entirely and you will have no way of turning the board off.
                </p>

                <h3 id="btn-mode" class="block-title">MODE Button - Flashing Mode</h3>
                <p>
                  When you click this button, the board will cycle between the various flashing modes. Depending on the board you have, the number of modes is different. But there will always be a solid mode, and a random mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you change to a new mode, the pattern will flash quickly for one cycle before it settles into it's regular speed. The speed also resets to the fastest speed. See below for how to change the speed
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="section-block">
                <h3 id="btn-speed" class="block-title">SPEED Button - Flashing Speed</h3>
                <p>
                  When you click the button, the speed at which the pattern changes will slow down. There are about 7 - 8 speed steps and each time you click on it, it will slow down the pattern changing. After you reach the slowest, it will cycle back and the pattern will cycle through at the fastest rate again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that if you are clicking the speed button, and nothing happens. It probably means you are on a mode that only has one pattern and changing the speed will not affect anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Changing the mode will reset the speed to the fastest one.

                <p>
                  There is only manual brightness for this. When you click the brightness button the lights will get dimmer. Once it reaches the minimum dimness, it will cycle back to the brightest.
                </p>
                <strong>Singapore 2030, SF Bay Area, Tokyo JR <a class="scrollto" style="color:inherit; cursor:help" title="Limited Feature" href="#feature-limits"><i class="fas fa-microchip"></i></a></strong>
                <p>
                  These boards have an auto brightness sensor. To find out if you are on auto brightness, click the BRIGHTNESS button. If nothing happens that means you are on auto brightness. You can also cover the light sensor to see if the board reacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To change toggle between auto and manual brightness, press and hold the BRIGHTNESS button. The board will flash twice to indicate the mode has been changed
                </p>
                <p>
                  Short followed by Long flash means it is in auto brightness mode
                </p>
                <p>
                  Long followed by Long flash means it is in manual brightness mode
                </p>
                <p>
                  When in manual brightness mode, the behaviour is exactly the same as the Singapore 2027 board. Clicking the button will cycle through the brightness levels.
